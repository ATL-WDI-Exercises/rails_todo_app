# Bonus LAB Material

* Change the UX:
  - Add a nice background image.
  - Try using other Bootswatch themes.
  - Change the NavBar.
* Add some more information to a user, such as `phone`, `city` and `state`, `occupation`, etc.
* Add some more attributes to a TODO, such as a `due_date` and a `priority`.
* Add a set of `keywords` to a Todo. There should be a `many-to-many` relationship between `todos` and `keywords` and the code should *not* create duplicate keywords.
* Replace the manual authentication with a gem like [Devise](http://devise.plataformatec.com.br/).
